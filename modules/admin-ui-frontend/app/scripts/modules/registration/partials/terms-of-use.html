  Opencast is free, open-source software - so why do we bother you with registration and feedback?
  Well, data on the usage of Opencast is important for us.  When it comes to discussions with hardware vendors about
  cooperation and compatibility they want to know how large the market is before they make any decision. Likewise,
  public funding for further development relies on such data.  Finally, we also need the feedback to further develop
  Opencast in line with its usage.

<p style="padding-bottom: 15px">
  Note that you can choose which data you want to provide and do not have to
  agree to sending data from all categories.
